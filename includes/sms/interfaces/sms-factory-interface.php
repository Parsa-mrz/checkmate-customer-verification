 * Interface Sms_Factory_Interface

 * SMS gateway driver instances. It decouples the client code (which needs to send an SMS)
 * from the concrete implementation of a specific SMS provider. This allows for
 * easy switching between different SMS gateways based on configuration without
 * modifying the core application logic.
